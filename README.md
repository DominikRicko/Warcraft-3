# Warcraft 3 Miscellaneous Codes
A repository containing all useful little code snippets, systems or spells for Warcraft 3 map modding

## Application
These codes are pasted inside the Warcraft 3 World Editor's Trigger Editor. After that, they can be used in whatever scenario map you're working on.

Some of these might be unfinished. Others should be working just fine.
